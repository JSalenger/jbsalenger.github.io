I have created an approx. 3-day-long climate modeling course aimed at children in the 5th through 9th grades. The materials are downloadable here:

- [Presentation 1 (Radiation & Heat in Space)](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFnWoeDA6w/56_XeIRDp3xDXUJYbh_5Bw/edit?utm_content=DAFnWoeDA6w&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)
- [Presentation 2 (Equilibrium & The Kitchen Sink)](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFnWh9kv40/A1PHbCTOFcHcEZphfJo-0w/edit?utm_content=DAFnWh9kv40&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)
- [Presentation 3 (Modeling Equilibrium)](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFuuSRimIo/pAniIM3NXqqLK0KNQC_JMw/edit?utm_content=DAFuuSRimIo&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)
- Worksheets forthcoming...

Please let me know if any of the links stop working or if you would like help integrating these into your classroom!
